# Bayesian_phylogenetics
Materials for Bayesian phylogenetics tutorial

This tutorial requires prior installation of Tracer (downloaded from https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases) and FigTree (downloaded from https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases)

In this tutorial, we will analyse the output from BEAST analyses of two pandemic variants of norovirus, a highly prevalent cause of gastroenteritis. We aim to:
1) Identify the substitution rate of each variant
2) Compare the substitution rates between variants
3) Examine ancestor dates to make inferences about the drivers of pandemic spread
